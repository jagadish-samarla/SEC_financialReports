This is data science assignment which deals with sentiment analysis of SEC/EDGAR to different companies.
Tried to code the entire web scraping and Text analysis in the same code, but SEC/EDGAR website is not responding when to try scrape, by writing code on google collab.
Used one of IDE to scrape the data from website and then used google collab to perform text analysis as it is much faster to execute these kind of codes.
Note : 'percentage_of_complex_words' is calculated as per the given formula in the Text Analysis.
